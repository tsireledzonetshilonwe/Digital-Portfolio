## ðŸ§© Career Counselling

As part of my career development training, I completed a formative quiz assessing my understanding of goal setting, career planning, and hard vs. soft skills.

This assessment helped reinforce my understanding of:
- The importance of setting goals in career counselling
- The role of hard and soft skills in career planning
- Key terminology in career development

# Career Readiness Reflection (STAR Technique)

## Situation
During the Career Readiness module, we were introduced to activities aimed at helping us explore possible career paths. One of these was an online quiz that looked at our personality, values, and strengths.

## Task
I needed to complete the quiz and use the results to find a career path that fits me, especially in the ICT field.

## Action
I took the quiz honestly, answering questions about my interests, skills, and work preferences. After reviewing the results, I found that roles in software development and quality assurance matched my interests and skills wellâ€”especially since Iâ€™ve been getting more into coding and testing lately.

## Result
The quiz helped confirm my interest in software engineering and testing roles. It gave me clearer insight into the skills I should focus on, like programming, problem-solving, and communication, which makes me more confident about my career direction.
