# 💼 Career Readiness Reflection (STAR Technique)

## ⭐ Situation  
During the Career Readiness module, we were introduced to activities aimed at helping us explore possible career paths. One of these was an online quiz that looked at our personality, values, and strengths.

## 🎯 Task  
I needed to complete the quiz and use the results to find a career path that fits me, especially in the ICT field.

## ⚙️ Action  
I took the quiz honestly, answering questions about my interests, skills, and work preferences. After reviewing the results, I found that roles in software development and quality assurance matched my interests and skills well—especially since I’ve been getting more into coding and testing lately.

## ✅ Result  
The quiz helped confirm my interest in software engineering and testing roles. It gave me clearer insight into the skills I should focus on, like programming, problem-solving, and communication, which makes me more confident about my career direction.
